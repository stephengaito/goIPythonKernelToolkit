/*

The goIPyRubyAdaptor provides the interface from the goKernel to an embedded 
(MRI) Ruby runtime instance (http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). 

Some of the folowing GoDoc documentation, such as the `Dir`, as well as 
the `FSXXX` functions, come from our use of Matt Jibson's esc tool 
(https://github.com/mjibson/esc) to embed the IPyRubyData.rb code directly 
into the IPyRuby kernel executable itself.
